# Deep Visualization Toolbox

This is the code required to run the Deep Visualization Toolbox, as well as to generate the neuron-by-neuron visualizations using regularized optimization as described casually [here](http://yosinski.com/deepvis) and more formally in this paper:

## Setting up and running the toolbox

### Step 0: Compile master branch of caffe (optional but recommended)

Get the master branch of [Caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/) to compile on your
machine. If you've never used Caffe before, it can take a bit of time to get all the required libraries in place. Fortunately, the [installation process is well documented](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/installation.html). When you're installing OpenCV, install the Python bindings as well (see Step 2 below).

Note: When compiling Caffe, you can set `CPU_ONLY := 1` in your `Makefile.config` to skip all the Cuda/GPU stuff. The Deep Visualization Toolbox can run with Caffe in either CPU or GPU mode, and it's simpler to get Caffe to compile in `CPU_ONLY` mode.



### Step 1: Compile the deconv-deep-vis-toolbox branch of caffe

Instead of using the master branch of Caffe, to use the demo
you'll need the slightly modified [deconv-deep-vis-toolbox Caffe branch](https://github.com/yosinski/caffe/tree/deconv-deep-vis-toolbox) (supporting deconv and a few
extra Python bindings). Getting the branch and switching to it is easy.
Starting from your caffe directory, run:

    $ git remote add yosinski https://github.com/yosinski/caffe.git
    $ git fetch --all
    $ git checkout --track -b deconv-deep-vis-toolbox yosinski/deconv-deep-vis-toolbox
    $ make clean
    $ make -j
    $ make -j pycaffe

As noted above, feel free to compile in `CPU_ONLY` mode if desired.



### Step 2: Install prerequisites

The only prerequisites beyond those required for Caffe are `python-opencv` and `scipy`, which may be installed as follows (other install options exist as well):

#### Ubuntu:

    $ sudo apt-get install python-opencv
    $ sudo apt-get install scipy

#### Mac using [homebrew](http://brew.sh/):

Install `python-opencv` using one of the following two lines, depending on whether you want to compile using Intel TBB to enable parallel operations:

    $ brew install opencv
    $ brew install --with-tbb opencv

Install `scipy` either with OpenBLAS...

    $ brew install openblas
    $ brew install --with-openblas scipy

...or without it

    $ brew install scipy

You may have already installed the `python-opencv` bindings as part of the Caffe setup process. If `import cv2` works from Python, then you're all set. Similarly for `import scipy`.



### Step 3: Download and configure Deep Visualization Toolbox code

You can put it wherever you like:

    $ git clone https://github.com/yosinski/deep-visualization-toolbox
    $ cd deep-visualization-toolbox

Copy `settings.py.template` to `settings.py` and edit it so the `caffevis_caffe_root` variable points to the directory where you've compiled caffe in Step 1:

    $ cp settings.py.template settings.py
    $ < edit settings.py >

Download the example model weights and corresponding top-9 visualizations saved as jpg (downloads a 230MB model and 1.1GB of jpgs to show as visualization):

    $ cd models/caffenet-yos/
    $ ./fetch.sh



### Step 4: Run it!

Simple:

    $ ./run_toolbox.py

Once the toolbox is running, push 'h' to show a help screen. You can also have a look at `bindings.py` to see what the various keys do. If the window is too large or too small for your screen, set the `global_scale` variable in `settings.py` to a value smaller or larger than 1.0.



# Troubleshooting

If you have any problems running the Deep Vis Toolbox, here are a few things to try:

 * Make sure you can compile the master branch of Caffe (Step 0 above)! If you can't, see the [detailed compilation instructions for Caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/installation.html). If you encounter issues, the [caffe-users](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/caffe-users) mailing list is a good place to look for solutions others have found.
 * Try using the `dev` branch of this toolbox instead of `master` (`git checkout dev`). Sometimes it's a little more up to date.
 * If you get an error (`AttributeError: 'Classifier' object has no attribute 'backward_from_layer'`) when switching to backprop or deconv modes, it's because your compiled branch of Caffe does not have the necessary Python bindings for backprop/deconv. Follow the directions in "Step 1: Compile the deconv-deep-vis-toolbox branch of caffe" above.
 * If the backprop pane in the lower left is just gray, it's probably because backprop and deconv are producing all zeros. By default, Caffe won't compute derivatives at the data layer, because they're not needed to update parameters. The fix is simple: just add "force_backward: true" to your network prototxt, [like this](https://github.com/yosinski/deep-visualization-toolbox/blob/master/models/caffenet-yos/caffenet-yos-deploy.prototxt#L7).
 * If the toolbox runs but the keys don't respond as expected, this may be because keys behave differently on different platforms. Run the `test_keys.py` script to test behavior on your system.
 * If you're unsure if your `settings.py` file contains sane values, run `test_settings.py` to see if `settings.py` defines all the appropriate variables and to see which have been changed vs. the included `settings.py.template`.
 * If none of that helps, feel free to [email me](http://yosinski.com/) or [submit an issue](https://github.com/yosinski/deep-visualization-toolbox/issues). I might have left out an important detail here or there :).

If you're desperate, it's also possible to [run the toolbox on Amazon EC2](doc/deep-vis-on-aws.md), but display will be much slower and images can be loaded only from file (not from webcam).
